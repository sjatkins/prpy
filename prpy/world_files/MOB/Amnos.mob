The lizard stands about five feet tall.  It has a long tail that wags
lazily behind it.  The lizard is well muscled so this kind of work must
be its only job.  It carries two thick tree trunks along the trail,
waiting to be told where to put them.  It stares impatiently at the
chubby lizard and shouts something in their language.  It was probably
not very friendly.

Dressed in all black and crouched in the corner, the dwarven prince is

up and starts to walk towards you, hands still covering his face.  He
removes his hands and lets out a loud shriek.  Better run before the
guards hear it.

A piercing pressure comes sharply and quickly from your neck.  Looking

weapon.  A low hiss whispers in your ear, "You've wandered a little
far from the trail.  I suggest you turn around.".  Without so much as
a sound the lizard is gone.  It's almost as if he was never there.
