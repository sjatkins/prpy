Completely black, the demon looks almost like a shadow flying through
the air.  It comes to a complete stop and begins to look around the
abyss.  A red glimmer emits from its eye sockets as it glares around
its surroundings.  What could it be looking for?  It's diffcult to 
judge as it floats in the air, but the demon seems to be about seven
feet tall.  A long curved neck stretches out from the top of its torso.
Its head looks like a hammerhead sharks, lying lengthwise on the top
of its neck.

The demon hovers in mid-air with a glowing blue soul in its claws.  It

Whipping its long neck into the air, the demon gulps down large pieces
of the soul.  It is difficult to tell from here, but the demon appears
to be about seven feet tall.  Its body is completely black, except for
the deep red glimmer from its eyes.  The demon seems to notice you
as its long neck slowly turns in your direction, but it quickly returns
to its meal.

long blade-like nails.  You almost think its smiling as it closes in,

The demon is laughing hysterically at the male demon's jokes and comments.
She sticks her fingers in her hair and begins to twirls some strands
as he continues to talk.  She seems very interested in what he has
to say, or is very concerned with her hair.  Regardless, her laugh
is making you want to bash her head in.

The snack cake vender smiles at you from behind its kiosk.  The demon
is quite large and has obviously not been excersizing.  Broccoli has
never been in this demon's diet.  It reaches under the counter and
pulls out a silver tray full of delicious looking baked goods.  They
smell even better than they look.  It points from the tray to you and
back to the tray.  The demon must want to you to gorge yourself as it
has.

hue.  With each movement, a spray of banana colored slime squirts out 
from random spots and all over the cave.  The demon is almost in a 
puddle of its own waste.  That's just nasty.

stopping at the last minute when it realizes that you are in fact, not a demon.

"Did you hear my sister in the caverns above?", he shouts at you.
"KILL THEM ALL!", he says before turning and running down another hallway.

almost every piece.  You notice the angel is extremely beautiful as
she flings her long brown hear over her shoulder to get it out of her
face.  She notices you staring and gives a little smile.  "Here to
help human?", she states plainly, "You must have found my sister.".
"Just kill them all!", she says slowly losing her smile. "We do not
