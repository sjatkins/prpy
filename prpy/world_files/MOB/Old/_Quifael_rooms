It is one of those irritating little creatures that like to infect innocent

She is no less than beautiful, skin as dark as the night and hair shining like
silver in the moonlight.  Her slender body is adorned with a sleeveless shirt
and a short skirt made from black scales joined with silver threads.  Her back
is covered by a large, hooded cloak as black as her skin and in her broad
silver belt hangs a long, slender sword in a silver scabbard.
