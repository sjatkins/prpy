It is obviously a large creature, but an improbable number of sharp
blades, claws and edges makes it near impossible to see its actual
body. It is gleaming, a metallic black, although occasionally a claw or
blade changes colour for a while, becoming a neon yellow.

It is a smallish creature, with too many legs to count, obviously

It is _very_ large, some 10 yds in length, walking on several hundred
tiny legs. It is metallic-looking, with large spots of corrosion
marring its angular skin. On its sides are large signs, written in an
incomprehensible language. On its top, a small eye cluster swivels back
and forth continually. A number of tentacles sweeps the ground around
it.

It is, on closer inspection, not really an animal, but a variable
number of brightly-coloured, translucent planes of breathtaking beauty
and delicacy. The planes pulse, waver, sometimes disappear, but are
always replaced by another. None of the planes move, but through
continuous replacement, the butterfly does, in random sweeps.

He is dressed in jeans, boots, a hat that shades his face so that it
is hard to see, where he's looking. He is walking around purposefully,
as if searching for something, occasionally getting down to one knee,
making strange passes in the air, then picking up pieces of the ground
that are apparently not so solid now. He is carrying a leather satchel
over the shoulder, into which he sometimes place some of the pieces. At
his belt hangs a strange, bluish whip
When ne notices your intense scrutiny, he looks at you coldly, until you
are forced to look away.
