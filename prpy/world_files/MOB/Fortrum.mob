Fortrum and sought to unite the clans under a single, powerful King.
That King was himself, Surtur the Demonic.  His failure to unite the
clans was offset by his prize at winning his brother's daughter for
his wife.  Now they and their son Loki strive to assert their claim
upon Fortrum.  Surtur, Loki and Hela are the doom of Fortrum, and
they will bring around the Ragnorak, the prophesied destruction of
the Dwarven kingdom.
