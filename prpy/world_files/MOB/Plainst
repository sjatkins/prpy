lizards where abouts.  A piercing pressure comes sharply and quickly
from your neck.  Looking as far back as you can, you can see a large
reptilian arm holding the weapon.  A low hiss whispers in your ear,
"Don't you even think of coming to the swamps.  Your kind is not welcome
there.".  Without so much as a sound the lizard is gone.  It's almost 
as if he was never there.
