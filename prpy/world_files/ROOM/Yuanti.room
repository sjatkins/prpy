accomodate Yuan-Ti guards and a hanging brazier provides a warm, almost
comforting light.  Beyond you can see a balustrade that looks out over a
wide cavern. Water cascades down from above it and sparkles like millions
of silver fish falling in unison.  You can exit west into the palace or

A corridor, or platform edged by a balustrade, encircles the whole of the
cavern. There is another below you and at the bottom there is a corridor
that stretches around the outside of the whirlpool area.  Rooms line the
platforms, some covered by hanging curtains and others left open, and it
is possible to make out Yuan-Ti furniture and artefacts in each.  There
are an obvious three levels to the palace complex.

The very bottom of the cavern has been carved in to a swirling corridor
that spirals in to a central point.  The water from the ceiling flows
down the corridor channels and seems to flow away beneath the central
point.

The balustrade on this level is very unique.  Each baluster has been hand
carved from the same hard sandstone of the cavern itself.  The details on
each one depict a pair of Yuan-Ti sitting with tails curled beneath them
on a pair of thrones.  Underneath the figures the words 'Divine Grace to
the Whirlpool Champion' can be read.  It looks like it might be possible
to climb down to the next level from here, were you brave enough to try
and descend.
