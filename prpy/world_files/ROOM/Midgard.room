"  This is the Bounce Room, where new residents of Perilous Realms
can get a bit of a head start on life.  If at any point you find
yourself with less than 16K experience, come here and bounce, and
your experience will be raised to that amount.
   Having done so, you can go to any guildmaster.  You will find your
nearest guildmaster next door to this room (GO DOOR).  While this
guildmaster can help young players, fully trained adventurers will
need to find other guildmasters.  Once at a guildmaster, don't forget
to type GAIN to get your news levels, until it says you don't have
enough exp.
   Having done that, you will generally have things you can practice.
To see a list, just type PRACTICE by itself.  There are some special
features of this command that make life a bit simpler, so reading the
HELP would be a good idea.  You should also read about the  prof,
spells, and skills   commands, which give you info about your chosen
class.  Khull the warrior can also be found next door, just go in and
say HELLO, he'll be more than happy to talk to you.
   Happy Hunting!

We hope that you won't get lost, but if you ever do, just keep walking
till you see a large block of marble embedded into the ground.  They're
usually found at most major intersections and always have a map etched
on their surface.  To help you get started, there are several posters
here you can look at.
The STREET map will show you how the layout works around here.
The GUILD poster has a map of where all the guilds in town are located.
and the ZONE poster will give you a feel as to what parts of town might
   carry what shops.
Oh yeah...I almost forgot.  There's also a SHOP poster which will tell
you where to find just about anything!

Happy Traveling! (And don't forget to look for those MAPS at all major
intersections...they'll keep you on the right track!)

### is whatever you want the minimum to be.  A minimum of 0 means there is
no minimum bid.  Should you fail to supply a minimum bid, either she will
hold it for a while and sell other items, or if enough time has passed she
will begin to sell it with no minimum bid.  You may only auction one item
at a time.  You may not bid on an item you have put up for sale.  You may
not bid on an item another one of your characters has put up for sale.  You
can BID on an item similar to setting a min, by TELLing it to her: "tell
auctioneer bid ###" where ### is your bid.  You must either bid OVER the
current bid, or if you are the first bidder you must match the MIN set by
the seller.  You must have the money ON YOUR PERSON in order to bid, because
once you put a bid in, you cannot leave until you have bought the item or
someone out-bids you.  If you have sold an item, and have not come to pick
it up, she will hold it for a reasonable amount of time, and if you have
not come to pick it up within that time, she will resell it.  To pay for an
item, simply GIVE the auctioneer coins equal to the price you bought it for.
She will then give you your item, and if the seller is around, will give them
their profit.  The auctioneer will keep a percentage of the fee.

REUSE THIS ROOM

It's hard to say exactly what this room looks like with all the
illusions running around.  Tiny dragons slay mystical beasts as the
floor opens to reveal the fiery pits of hell.  A portal on the east
wall looks like it might lead somewhere...if it would stay still long
enough.  An exit on the north wall leads back to the Iron Road...or
Valhalla, it's hard to say.

"   This book describes the history of the Inn in great detail, beginning
thusly:

   It came about that a young man was born in the village of Zyre, and that
upon reaching his maturity did seek the world itself, and so began a life in
adventuring.  The name given him by his parents was "Jsil", a simple name
that translates roughly to correspond to the feeling one might have lying on
their back in a field of wild flowers.  He left the village because he felt
in himself a compulsion to do so, but went with a heavy heart and numerous
misgivings.

   For many years, he travelled, learning the ways of magic and warcraft, and
growing in renown.  One of his adventures took him to the Terhim Barrows,
and he emerged from them a changed man, mistaken for mad by his companions. He
claimed to have been granted a prophecy while deep in the barrows, and to have
seen his beloved village razed to the ground.  To appease him, his companions
elected to come with him to the village, sure that he would return to his
merry self upon seeing that nothing untoward had occurred in his absence.

   This was not the case.  The village, unvisited by Jsil for many years, had
been utterly destroyed.  Not a trace of its inhabitants remained, save for
the burnt husks of houses and the occasional bone, bleached by the sun and
likely belonging to a loved one of Jsil's. His grief overcame him, and he
stumbled into the holy grove in the center of the village, though the trees
were now warped and twisted.  As he gazed down, however, he saw something
astonishing: the floor of the grove was carpeted in brilliantly crimson
clovers.

   Once more, Jsil emerged from a place of death changed.  His madness and
grief had left him, or else had transmuted into a horrible resolve.  He
dedicated his life -- and it proved to be an exceptionally long one -- to
the annihilation of those who had seen fit to destroy his home.  He sought
out all who might have information, and gathered it, compelling it by force
and by magics, until he at last uncovered the identity of the nobles who had
given the order, who had slaughtered his people in the hopes that they would
reveal the secrets of the grove, secrets which existed only in folktales.

   Those nobles dwelt where you now stand.  This inn was once their house,
symbol of their lineage.  Jsil, now dubbed "Khalis'az'In" -- bloodletter --
marched from room to room, massacring every inhabitant, from the youngest
child to the most revered elder.  Upon finishing his work, he impaled himself
within the room that now bears the mosaic of the clover.

   This mosaic did not appear unnaturally, however.  It was created by master
craftsmen hired by Skriven, the founder of the inn.  The property, widely
believed to be cursed, was essentially granted to Skriven by the city due to
his valour in a relatively minor battle.  After researching the source of the
alleged "curse", Skriven elected to celebrate rather than conceal the heritage
behind the structure.

   It is for these reasons that this Inn is known as "The Crimson Clover".

This place smells like city people. I don't like it.         -- Trink

It's a bit morbid here, isn't it?  I mean, it's the site of a brutal massacre.

warm those who would sleep here.  Unlike the common rooms of most inns, this
one provides for enough space that a guest need not feel uncomfortable due to
his proximity to others.  There also appears to be a marked lack of insects
and rodents, perhaps due to the washing basins distributed amongst the beds.

MOVEMENT
--------

   Movement is core to the game.  At the bottom of every room description
there is a line starting with "Exits: ".  The exits are listed.  Some
will be directions, such as NORTH, SOUTH... some will be names, like DOOR.
To go in a particular direction, all you need do is type GO <exit>, for
example GO NORTH, GO TOWER.  There are ten basic directions, NORTH, SOUTH,
EAST, WEST, NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, UP and DOWN.  To
move in these directions you just need type NORTH or DOWN.

   Most commands in Perilous Realms (PR) can be abbreviated, so to move in
these directions, it is possible to just type N, S, E, W.  However to go
through a named exit, you need to type GO <exit>

   A very useful option is the ability to follow someone else.  To do this
all you need type is FOLLOW <person>, for example "follow fionn".

   Movement is not possible if you are sitting or sleeping.  Sleeping is
useful if you want to recover from your wounds quickly.  To go to sleep
type SLEEP, to wake type, WAKE.  You may also want to sit down (SIT), but
to move you'll need to stand up again (STAND).

   For more information on these topics, type HELP MOVEMENT.  Each subtopic
also has it's own help file.

   To leave this room, go through the exit.

COMMUNICATION
-------------

   Communication is very important in any multi-user game.  Whether you
wish to talk to people or talk to interactive computer generated characters,
you'll need to understand the basic skills.  Communication on PR is divided
into four categories, entire mud, local area, within your room, private one
to one.

Private One-to-One Communication
--------------------------------
   This is very important and no-one but your target can hear what you say.
The main way to do this is to tell someone, TELL <name> <message>, for
example "TELL FIONN HELLO".  If the person is online, they will receive
your message, irrespective of where they are.  Another technique is to
whisper your message, but you need to be in the same room as them, for
example WHISPER FIONN HELLO.

Within Room Broadcasts
----------------------
   With this you can tell everyone in a room something, by saying a message,
for example, "SAY HELLO", everyone will hear hello.  The command SAY can be
abbreviated by single quote ', for example 'HELLO

  This explanation is continued in the next room, please type "GO UP" or "UP"
to see the remainder of the discussion.

Local Area Broadcasts
---------------------
   You can tell everyone in the rooms near you something by SHOUTing.  If you
type SHOUT HELLO, those near you will hear HELLO.  It is rude to shout
frequently, but if you are doing something like a spell that may hurt them, it
is wise to warn them to stay out.

Global Broadcasts
-----------------
   You can chat to everyone online with GOSSIP.  This is for non-game related
information, such as football results, etc.  The only game related information
you're allowed broadcast is when you gain a new level.  You only obtain
access to global broadcast channels once you reach level 8.  This is to prevent
abuse by people just logging in a new character to cause trouble.

   To get more information on these topics, type HELP COMMUNICATION.  To go
to the next room, type "GO UP".

Leaving the Game
----------------

   When you are finished playing the game, you need to rest your weary bones.
In Perilous Realms we have a RENT system.  It is free and we do not have any
level restrictions on RENTing.  What you need to do is find a receptionist in
an inn and type RENT.  If you type RENT and you are not in the right place,
you'll be told that you can't do that here.

   What you should never do is type QUIT.  If you type quit, you will leave the
game however all your equipment will fall off you.

   The centre of the PR game is the underground tavern in Midgard.  This is
where all players start.  There is a receptionist in this tavern.  There is
a receptionist in most major towns in the game.

Learning About your Character
-----------------------------

The main command to learn how your character is doing is to type SCORE.
Another command is ATTRIBUTE (ATT).  Type SCORE now, and you should see
something like the following

   You are 17 years old. It's your birthday today.
   You have 29(29) hit, 100(100) mana, 100(100) power, and 161(161) move
   Your alignment (-1000 : +1000): 0
   Your questpoint total is: 0
   You have 50 gold coins on hand, and 0 in the bank.
   You are a male Human Warrior at level 1 with 1 exp.
   You need 999 XP to advance a level.
   You are: Laughy says, "I haven't used the TITLE command yet!"
   You have been playing for 0 days and 0 hours.
   You are standing.

This shows how many hit points you have, power, moves.  Your
alignment, your gold reserves.  It also shows how much XP you have
and how many points you need to get to the next level.

Now type ATT.  Between the information given by SCORE and ATT you
can identify your abilities.  Much of this information you might
not want to share with other competitors.   For more information
type HELP SCORE, HELP ATT.  Type "GO UP" or "UP" to go to the
next room.

WEARING EQUIPMENT
-----------------

   In PR, everyone has the basic peasants cloth clothes, but
it is possible to wear other equipment such as armor, hats,
boots.  To see what you are holding type INV (short for
inventory.  You should see a list of objects.  To wear them,
you can type "WEAR <name>".  A shortcut would be to type
"WEAR ALL".  Type this.  Now that you are wearing something,
type EQ (short for equipment) to see what you're wearing.
You should see something like the following:
   You are using:
   [1] <worn on body>       a studded leather training jacket
   [2] <worn on head>       a leather training helm
   [3] <worn as shield>     a training shield
   [4] <wielded>            a long training sword

To remove an article of clothing, type "REMOVE <name>" or
more simply "REMOVE ALL".  For more information type HELP OBJECTS.
Each subtopic also has it's own help file. .  Type "GO UP" or "UP"

PRACTISING SKILLS
-----------------
   In Perilous Realms, everyone has a range of skills, spells and
proficiencies.  It is necessary to practice these to be able
to use them.  If you type PRACTICE you will see something like
the following, though it will differ from class to class:

   You have got 50 practice sessions left.
   You can practice any of these skills:
   Level Name             Difficulty cost GLD MAX How Well
   [  1] kick                   1     0    95  95 0
   [  1] bash                   3     0    95  95 0
   You can practice any of these proficiencies:
   Level Two  Name             Difficulty cost GLD MAX How Well
   [  1]      shortsword             1     0   100 100 0
   [  1]      longsword              1     0   100 100 90

   This says that I can use longsword at 90% of my maximum
ability but nothing else.  To use these other skills, I'll need
to practice these at a guildmaster.  You have a limited number
of practices, currently 50.  You gain more as you gain levels.
It just happens that there is one here, so pick a proficiency
that you want to use, and type for example PRACTICE LONGSWORD
If you want to practice many types, type PRACTICE 10 DAGGER.
Go on, practice your weapon skills.. you'll need it to fight.
For more information type HELP PRACTICE. Type "GO UP" or "UP"

COMBAT
------

   To suceed in the world of Perilous Realms you'll need to fight.
It is the only way to gain experience points (XPs).  The simple
way to start a fight is to say "HIT <target>".  However before
we do this there is a second important command to learn.  That
is the CONSIDER command.  This is used by saying "CONSIDER <target>"
It will give you an indication whether you'll win the fight or not.
It's not guaranteed either way, but it will give you an idea.
There are several creatures in the room here.  Try type CONSIDER
at the various creatures, for example CONSIDER SPAVE, and
look at the results.  Some of the typical responses are the following:

    Too easy to be believed            - No problem
    Rather easy.
    You're a bit more skilful.
    The perfect match!
    You would need a lot of luck!

COMBAT
------

   In this room we have a small duckling.  To kill your first
creature, type "KILL DUCKLING".  This is the same procedure that
you can use on all other creatures.  As you advance you will learn
different techniques to maximise damage.  If you're a spell-caster
and you have a spell you have practised, you can start combat by
casting an attack-spell in the following way
"CAST 'MAGIC MISSILE' DUCKLING".

   When you've killed the duckling, do a LOOK, you'll be able to see
that there is a corpse in the room.  You can get items from a
corpse by typing "GET ALL CORPSE".  In this case you should get some
gold.

   Type SCORE, you should notice that your experience has gone up
and you'll need less experience points to get to your next level.

GAINING LEVELS and OTHER MATTERS
--------------------------------

   Once you have enough experience points, it's time to find a
guildmaster and type GAIN.  This will let you gain levels.  There
are plenty of guildmasters around the city of Midgard.

   As a starting bonus, in the tavern, if you go down from the
entry room, there is a room called BOUNCE.  Type BOUNCE, and you
will get a bonus of enough XP for 4 levels.  Then go to a
guildmaster and gain a few levels and practice your weapons.

   In the tavern there is a room to the south called The Donation
Room.  In here equipment is donated by other players.  There
can be surprisingly good equipment here.  It is a useful place to
pick up free gear.  It only works if people donate, so remember
to donate when you have excess equipment.

   There are boards situated around the world.  Some of these
you can post to, these are used for general chat, opinions,
anything non-offensive.  There are also boards for immortals
postings, these are generally about quests, rules, guidelines,
requests for builders.

   To enter the game, just go UP from here.  Thank you for
reading these messages, and I hope you enjoy yourself in our
world.

  name { A Plain of Tall Grass  }
  desc {
"   Plains of grass dominate the landscape here. The
shifting colours of summer-green vegetation reach
out towards the horizon in all directions,
resembling that of a thick green carpet. The warming
sun has begun to rise above the horizon line, the
rays of light making the plains shift slightly towards
yellow in colour. The grass is layered where it has
been grazed by animals. Along with the arrival of the
morning, the sounds of life comes, insects hidden in
the tall grass giving of various noises, and birds
circling the morning sky.

  name { Surrounded by Trees of the Pine Forest  }
  desc {
"   The air lies still within the forest. The sun has
just risen above the horizon, causing the temperature
to raise. Morning fog covers the area of the pine
forest; a damp smell fills the air. The pine trees stand
close to each other, branches reaching up towards the
summer sky. Various paths trail of into all directions,
some smaller than others. The leafs shift in colour as
the sun rays touch them, changing the colour from deep
green to bright yellow. Birdsong echoes through the
forest, as the soft summer breeze send leafs shaking.
