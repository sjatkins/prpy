"   The water is very serene and clear today.  You can see several fish of
different sizes and colors swimming all throughout the water.  There are
also several people snorkeling all along the ocean floor.  They must be
making their way down to the coral reef.  There is light filtering down
from the sun beaming high above the ocean.  You can probably exit the
ocean by emerging through the water above your head.  You can also swim
deeper into the ocean to the north, east and down.  The ocean currents
are entirely too strong to swim any further to the west and south.  Looking
straight down, you can see the coral reef in the distance.  The vibrant
colors of the animals and plants all along the reef stick out beautifully.
