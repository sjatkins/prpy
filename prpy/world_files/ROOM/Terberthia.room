"   Mogue spends most of his time here working out construction plans

the room, pencils, paper, batteries, erasers, and fragments of bitten
and chewed pen caps roll around the floor. 

An exit exists to another dimension.  It is clear that this is a secret
and hidden room by the one-way mirror trap door in ceiling.  Mogue wants
it that way so he will get it that way. 

A sign says "IMMORTALS and GUESTS Only!!" - Die Rebel Scum...perhaps
a reference ... is scrawled in blood, scratched into the ceiling. 
This room has properties typical of the immortal arena.
