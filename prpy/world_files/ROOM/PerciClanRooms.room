A few of the nasty creatures are milling about here but they arent interested in you. The place

rundown villa of Tarnak, the most notorious camel dealer and weapons smuggler in the land.

"   A veritable hoard of gold, gemstones, and magical toys that would make
an ancient wyrmkin jealous with envy. Ancient and long forgotten artifacts
are mixed in with the standard coinage of the realms, with gemstones of all
shapes, styles, color, and clarity sprinkled on top. Various items from the
planar travels are mixed in with the mundane gear of common adventurers, in
a haphazard chaotic spread.  Unfortunately this veritable mound of treasure
is covered in a thick heavy coat of grey dust, althought there are many paw
prints that can be seen.  Along the far wall are rows upon rows of ceramic
pots, filled to the brim with hunny. An occasional glint of shinys can be
seen through the dust, a twinkle or a glimmer, before fading from view.

Along the far wall are rows of stacked ceramic pots filled to the brim with
hunny, gathered by bee handlers that enjoy having their bees chase kenders.
This technique allows for a more savory hunny, a vertible gourmet treat for
small fuzzy grey bears.

There is quite a huge mound of this stuff, enough to make a family of wyrms
quite content to snooze for ages.

"   Thick walls of solid thulium resist the onslaught of the monsters
stored within.  The shattered and broken remains of claws and fangs,
lay scattered amidst the crimson piles of rusting armor and weapons.
There are torn and ripped dessicated hides, lying amidst the jagged
and jutting remains of yellowed bones.  A faint howling cry of deep
despair whispers throughout the chamber and fades away to a tranquil
deep silence.

"   A large, foreboding cave with a small sign on the entrance that
states in bold red letters, "Do Not Disturb."  Within the cave, are
rows upon rows of metallic boxes, each marked clearly in bold, easy-
to-read letters: "Beeping Thermal Detonators- Keep Out of Reach of
Bears!"  Huge piles of gems and jewelry are scattered all over the
cave, mixed together with coins of all shapes, denominations, and
types.  Shinys from all across the spans of time and dimensions lie
here on the ground, like so much junk. There are rune covered wands
and staves, sigil etched daggers and swords, dweomermarked armours
and shields, and other assorted shinys, strewn all about the cave.
Lastly, to finish off the decor of the bear cave, are empty pots of
hunny lying on the floor, with hunny paw prints all along the cave.
