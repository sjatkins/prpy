corridor stretches off in to darkness.  You strain your ears to listen
but all around you is silent.  The corridor is 10 foot wide by 10 foot
high.  At a guess you measure the walls, floor and ceiling to be made of
massive  blocks of granite.  The blocks have been so well made that they
fit seem-lessly together so that only the merest hairsbreadth of gap
exists.  They are also smooth and cold to the touch.  The floor is clear
of any dust or debris.  It would be impossible to tell if anything has
passed through here recently.  You can exit up, back out of the Labyrinth
