bolts engraved upon its cover, in the other hand he holds a sick child.

"   Aelen, the most honoured and revered of all the brethren of our order 
in his time collected a massive library of ancient lore.  One of his 
great achievements was the rediscovery and control of the ancient 
magics, power from the earth but this time control from the spirit and 
the soul.  With his light to lead us, Aelen shows us that power is not 
the answer, the answer and solution comes from within, from ourselves 
and our faith.  A main priority of Aelen was to shift the use of the 
magic from the dangerous violent uses of old to healing and mending,
he thought it especially important to care for the sick and weak, for as
he was fond of saying 'Are not their souls as valuable as my own'.

Surrounding you are magnificent Corinthian columns carved from 
black marble, and capped in pure ivory. The columns seem to have
grown straight out of the glossy black marble floor and stretch into 
the vaulted ceiling above. Hanging on the walls are banners brightly 
coloured with the Notorious coat of arms as well as tapestries 
depicting legendary battles fought by the guild. Grand archways 
lead to the north and east, illuminated by a large hearth in middle of 
the room.

Stretching before you is a long wooden hallway with many torches 
lining the walls. You can see multiple doorways on each side, all with 
an individual nameplate on the door. These are the private rooms of 
the Notorious guild. Each room is exclusively restricted to that 
particular member, but you catch a glimpse through a crack in one 
of the doorways and marvel at the luxury these members enjoy.

fireplace on the far wall.  The fire crackles peacefully, shedding a 
warm light on the room and glinting off the golden frame of a circular 
mirror in the back of the room. Soft carpeting on the floor and the smell 
of fine ale complete the comfortable atmosphere for the Notorious guild
