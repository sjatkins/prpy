casting an almost grinning shadowy reflection on the ground.  A couple of

off the swing, holds a blue book bag high and dumps all of its contents
onto the dirt.  The boy still has his red book bag strapped to his back,
so this is obviously someone else's possession.  The kids are having so
much fun that they do not notice a creeping shadow sneaking up behind a
large metal slide, slowly drawing a long knife from a hilt.  The only
