"   A wooden walkway extends to the southeast, ending at a large tree in the
distance.  There are bright green vines growing to the east.  The vines are growing
along some thin wires that form a sort of wall before you.  The wires run from the
edge of the walkway to a metal watering device above your head.  The watering
system sprays out mists of water every few minutes, refreshing the flowers
and your face.  Some pale yellow flowers with shiny white petals grow all along
the vines.  Maybe the gnomes will not notice if you take one!  It appears that
you can climb down the vines from here to reach another walkway.
