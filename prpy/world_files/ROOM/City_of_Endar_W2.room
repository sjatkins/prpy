"   You are in the High Court of Endar.  It is a simple room, reminiscent of 
times when Endar was much smaller than it is now.  Above the judge's bench 
there is a large crest.  The furniture in the court consists of a large oak
bench, which the judge sits behind, two small desks before that, and far
behind those, several long benches for the public.  In one corner you can 
see a small barred box, in which to contain dangerous prisoners.  Along the
other wall, there are several chairs, for the jurors, in the few cases that 
they are needed for.  There is an atmosphere of solemnity about this room,
a sense of justice, of great things that have happened and have yet to 
happen.  At the moment the room is reasonably empty, the silence is paramount,
the echoes of previous trials echoing through the room.

young boy back to the Wharf.  Since then dolphins have been beloved of the

"   Here presented is an abstract from the Journals of Miller's Falls, 
describing the last days of the town, as the water rose to destroy the
town.  No corroborating evidence exists to either prove or disprove this
story, the Library leaves its veracity to the decision of the reader.
The journals consist of six segments, each distanced in time, covering
the period over which the town became flooded.
   The water level in the river is rising at a very fast rate.  I am afraid
that if it rises anymore that we might have to evacuate some parts of our
beautiful city.  The spring has been a very rough one, it hasn't stopped
raining for three months now.  We cannot mine for ore anymore because the
river has already flooded our tunnels that we mine in.  Many families have
already left to look for another place to live.  If the river keeps rising I
know that even more people will evacuate.  Why does this have to happen to us?
First we fight for our freedom, and now mother nature turns on us.
     
   The water level has kept rising, the part of the city closest to the river
is in danger of being submerged.  The water has already lapped up onto most
of our river banks and is now threatening some of our house's with flooding.
I do not know how much more of this I can take, I have already lost a lot of
business thanks to this damn flooding issue and now people have stopped coming
to our city.  I am losing too much from this threat of flooding, if this
keeps up all my customers will be gone and I will be out of a business and
have to move, Oh I do not want to leave my beautiful city that I love so
much.
      
   Most of the people in the city have moved now, COWARDS! let them leave.
There is a small band of us of approximately three hundred or so, that have 
agreed and promised we'd stay and help to keep our city intact.  We have
done all that we can, we have sandbagged the river and moved to the north
western most part of the city that is furthest from the river.  There is
nothing more we can do than wait, and see what Mother Nature has in store
for us.
     
   Disaster has struck!  The water that flowed through our tunnels has forced
its way through the mine and broke a new hole through solid rock and flooded
most of the city that is on the south-eastern side now is under ten plus feet
of water.  Everyone in that part of the city has evacuated and we are
helping each other, now all we have to do is wait....
       
   Why us?  Now we have a new problem, besides the fact that some of our city
is now underwater we now have to deal with some strange new sickness.  Our
only doctor that is left has no idea what this sickness is and the few
of us that are left are rapidly dying.  We need to find a cure before it is
too late.  Otherwise we might all die...
     
  I am the only one left, all the other people died or ran off madly, the         
sickness made a few of us go crazy and then kill each other.  The water has
brought monsters into our town too.  This may be for the better that everyone
has died.  Better to have died from a sickness then from some monsters.  This
will be my last entry considering that I don't have much time to live.  I now
lie back and close my eyes and wait for death to bring peace to me.  My only
hope is that these journals of what has happened to the people of Millers
Falls and the words within will not fall on deaf ears.  Good-Bye....

"   The Empire of Arandia is crumbling in the absence of it's Imperial
family.  The Emperor of Arandia left to Hyberia on a delicate political
mission, bringing his family with him, but at sea, it is said that a magical
storm hit his boat in the deep seas east of Arandia, and in any case he
and his family has been missing now for just over twenty years and many now
agree that a new successor must be chosen, for the Regent Emperor, though
a great warrior and fiercely loyal, has many opponents.  The Regent was
the former Duke of Tosk, assuming the reign and leaving his brother in
control of the Southern regions (The duchy of Tosk includes Agatar's Keep,
Tosk, Pharport, and Multigar).  But these southern regions are the only
regions in the once great Empire to remain totally loyal to the crown, with
independence-minded to outright rebellious regions in the North starting
to distance themselves from the throne.
   Norport and Oldport are both key trading cities, the main trade routes
to glacia and chressport respectively, and both are the homes of several
greater houses, with varying degrees of claim to the throne of Arador.  The
Marquis of Norport in particular is attempting to rally support for his own
claim, and plans to declare his intentions once he can rally the support of
the other noble houses.
   The regent Emperor is not blind to these ambitions, and decides to take
action, levying a tax on imports in order to break the backs of the merchant
backed houses of Norport and Oldport, supposedly to fund some small wars on
the Eastern end of the continent.  This tax has the opposite effect, however
to it's intentions, and the Marquis uses this opportunity to rally his 
support and declare himself "King of the Northern Realm", with the backing 
of Oldport and with a huge amount of Mercenaries funnelled in through 
Golbatron and Chressport.
   The Regent Emperor, always proud of his southern military background and 
tiring of politics, now decided to take it upon himself to utterly crush the 
noble houses of Norport and Oldport, and then lay claim once again to 
Golbatron and Chressport for their role in the upsurgence.  Armies gather in 
Tosk, Arador, and loyal cities to the south, while defences are strengthened 
in the north for the expected attack.  Meanwhile Tosk, Multigar and Pharport
launch their fleets, at the command of the Duke, to crush the merchant
based fleets of the north.  The regent Emperor assumes control of the
ground forces, and plans a daring march through cobb's pass to split the
power base in half and force Norport and Oldport to rely on the sea, while
he trusts to his brother the Duke to crush the merchant navy.  
   Meanwhile Hyberia has released news that Emperor Gerald and his family 
have been discovered on a small isle off Endar, shipwrecked there 20 years 
ago. Some believe that this accident was more than just an accident.  Some 
minor players have been executed for treason but their superiors have 
avoided detection.  The Emperor has been kept in a secure location for 
their own keeping, and some may suggest as hostages.  Upon the announcement
of the Emperors discovery, the Regent has decided to carry through his
plans and declare himself Emperor before the old emperor can regain 
support. He has also made it known that the seals of office are high
on his wanted list as they would endow legitimacy to his reign.
   As can be seen by this review of current political events, the current
world order is in an immense state of flux and new powerful players are
beginning to make their mark.

"   You are in a small residence.  There are few furnishings
but a small bed in the corner and a table.  off one one side of the room you
can see a small kitchen, partially hidden by a small protruding wall.  There
is only one window in the room.  It leads out onto the street. It is
only about two feet by two, and from here you can make out Illiad's Restuarant
and the corner of the street where it turns just before the park.  Once
nice thing about this house is the constant smell of baking coming from
Gregi's down the road.  The door looks secure, with a good lock.
