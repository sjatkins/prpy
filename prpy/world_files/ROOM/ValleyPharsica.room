mountain's edge, you can see the deep blue ocean surrounding the island
of Pharsica swim out to meet the horizon to the north and west.  A glimmer
of white light catches in the corner of your eye.  It appears to be coming
from the northwest, in the middle of the ocean.  What could be out there?

They nearly blow you off of the trail at certain points.  That would
certainly be a long way down.  The trail around the mountain continues up
