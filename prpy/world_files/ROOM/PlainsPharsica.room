the blank walls of Fortrum and even the the massive gate of the city.  A long 
rope and wood bridge extends out from the platform and seems to lead to another 
large mountain lying in the northeast.  Looking off the mountain, your breath

You stand upon a magnificent stone platform before the gateway to the bridge
to Fortrum.  To the north a massive gate leads to a huge marble bridge that
connects this platform to the tallest mountain in the range.  Here the dwarfs
have built Fortrum, capital of the Fortish Empire.  It is surrounded by huge
walls and a massive and highly ornate gate protects the city. There are is a 
rope and wood bridge leading to the west and south.  Two blazing torches line 
the entry way to each of the bridges.  A large wooden door lays in the middle 
of the platform.  The mountain must be able to be climbed down from there.  A
mountain road leads down off to the east.

The large stone platform juts out very unnaturally from the mountain.  It is
very sturdy but you cannot help to feel that it will slide down the mountain at
any moment.  Looking out across the rope and wood bridge to the west, 
you can see all the way to the mountain it connects to.   Two blazing torches 
line the entry ways to the bridges.  The lonely, swaying bridges are just inviting 
you to cross them.  To the north, Fortish engraved arches lead to another 
platform.
