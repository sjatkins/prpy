wounded, most are armed with  knives and daggers, spell books and war-
swords.  There is a large plaque over each door, with the names, 
APPRENTICE, SKILLED, EXPERT and MASTER.  Several people go through each 
door and others return with  wounds and damaged armour.  There is a 
large stone in the middle of the floor, within easy reach, which has 
some writing on it.

our arts can fabricate.  Be warned only the truest and surest of our
faith, the greatest masters of our order can stand along safely within
the rooms behind the black door.  Be warned, to all still learning

Monsters will appear, in some rooms one at a time, in others in groups,
and you will be forced to defend yourself.  After a fixed period of time
the magic of the room will teleport you back to this room.  These rooms
are essential for the practice and training of the clerics and paladins
