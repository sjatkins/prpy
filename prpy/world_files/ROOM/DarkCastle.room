high, spikey, pillars and beyond is the castle entrance, a massive gaping
maw full of sharp-looking decorations.  Inside the entrance you can see a
portcullis that has been invitingly raised.  The spikes along the bottom
of the portcullis give the entrance the look of a mouth about to snap
shut at any moment.  The forecourt and castle are all made of the same
dark stone.  You can't tell what it is but it seems to reflect a blood-
red luster.  The castle continues high into the sky where tall spikey
towers look ominously down upon you.  A sense of dread fills you.  Dare

and yet as solid as granite.  As you stare into it you feel that it seems
to reflect a blood-red luster.  You shiver.  The forecourt continues to

its years of wear have left it threadbare in places.  The walls are
covered in tapestries.  Each depicting strange battles and stranger look-
ing heroes.  They all appear to have been given pale skin and there seems
to be too much liking for the impaling and crucifiction of the losers.
Spaced evenly apart, but way out of your reach, large pools of oil burn
in sconces hanging from dark rafters.  Steam billows from them and seaps
lazily out of the entrance.  There is a rather unpleasant smell coming
from the east, but the oil torches are lit that way.  The corridor
continues in darkness to the west.  Which way will you choose?  You can
exit west in to darkness, east towards the terrible stench or back north

a little loose in places.  You can exit in any northerly direction, back
