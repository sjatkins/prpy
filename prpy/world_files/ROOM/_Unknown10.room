The smell of unwashed men, mixed in with the smell of the bathhouse, makes
for a very unpleasant smell.  Two long rows of bunkbeds adorn each wall of
the barracks.  The room stretches on for at least fifty spans and is a good
ten spans wide.  Small chests stand at the base of each bed, storing the
personal effects of each soldier.

the eastern barracks is by far the largest of the three barracks the city
has.  The fact that Mirkwood is just outside the city walls might have a
thing or two to do with it as well.  Looking towards the barracks you can
see a large, iron-wrought gate with two tall guard towers sitting to
either side of it.  Chunks off the walls have been lost over the years
due to sieges and such.

strung on their backs.  The barracks itself is just off to the left of you.
Soldiers spar with each other all around you, their actions seem almost routine.
